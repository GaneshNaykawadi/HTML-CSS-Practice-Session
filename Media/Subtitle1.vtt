Phir se ud chala
I flew once again
Ud ke chhoda hai jahaan neeche main tumhare ab hoon hawaale
I have flown and left the world down and now I surrender to You
Door door log baag meelon door ye waadiyaan
Now the people are miles away and all my sight there are beautiful clouds
Phir dhuaan dhuaan tan har badli chali aati hai chhoone
Now and then, some cloud filled with smoke comes and touches my body
Par koi badli kabhi kahin kar de tan geela ye bhi na ho...
But some cloud filled with water may make me wet
Kisi manzar par main ruka nahi
I didn't stop to see any sight
Kabhi khud se bhi mein mila nahi
I didn't even meet myself
Ye gila to hai main khafa nahi
This is a fault of mine, but I am not angry
Shehar ek se gaa'nv ek se
The cities are the same, so are the villages
Log ek se naam ek ooo
The people are the same, so are their names
Ooo o...
Phir se udd chala
I flew once again
Mitti jaise sapne ye kitta bhi palko se jhaado
These dreams are like sand, as much as I dust them from my eyelids
Phir aa jaate hain
They come again
Kitte saare sapne kya kahoon kis tarah se maine
So many dreams, I can't tell You in which way
Tode hain chhode... hain kyun
Broken them, Left them... Why
Phir sath chalein mujhe leke ude ye kyun
Still why they come with me and fly....Why
O o..
Kabhi daal daal kabhi paat paat
Sometimes from Branches, Sometimes from Leaves
Mere saath saath phire dar dar ye
With me on every step
Kabhi sehra kabhi saawan
Sometimes clouds, sometimes rain
Banu raawan jeeyun mar mar ke
I become Raavan (Ancient Villain), I live and die
Kabhi daal daal kabhi paat paat
Sometimes from Branches, Sometimes from Leaves
Kabhi din hai raat kabhi din din hai
Sometimes Day is Night, Sometimes Day is Day
Kya sacch hai, kya maaya
What is the truth, What is Myth
Hai daata, hai daata
Oh God, Oh God
Idhar udhar titar bitar
Here and there, scattered everywhere
Kya hai pata hawa le hi jaaye teri ore
How does the wind take me to You
Kheenche teri yaadein
Your thoughts pull me
Teri yaadein teri ore
Your thoughts pull me towards You
Rang-birange vehmon mein
In these coloured lies
Main udta phiru
I keep flying
Rang-birange vehamon mein
In these coloured lies
Main udta phiru
I keep flying
